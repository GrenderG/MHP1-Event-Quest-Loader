## Usage

Place the `ULJM05066QST` folder in `ms0:/PSP/SAVEDATA/` and enable the cheat. Then, you can access the quests from the event quest menu in the gathering hall.

## Notes

For Monster Hunter Portable [ULJM05066] only. I will look into possibly porting it to Freedom.

I also want to create a patch, alongside the cheat.
